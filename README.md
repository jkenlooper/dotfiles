# dotfiles

Collection of dotfiles for Jake Hickenlooper. I use a terminal mostly with tmux
and vim.

## `gig.json`

The keyboard I use is the [Keyboardio Atreus](https://shop.keyboard.io/collections/keyboardio-atreus). 

The `gig.json` file is a QMK keyboard layout based from [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/qmk_firmware/blob/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku/miryoku.org).

The `qmk` command is used to flash the keyboard via `qmk flash gig.json`.
